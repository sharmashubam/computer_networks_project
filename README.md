# Network Simulator

This project is a network simulator implementing the entire protocol stack, including functionalities for the Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, and Application layers.

## Overview

The network simulator is developed in Python and provides a framework to simulate various networking functionalities, including device creation, packet transmission, routing, and application layer services.

## Functionalities Implemented

### Submission 1: Physical and Data Link Layer

- **Physical Layer Functionalities:**
  - Creating end devices and hubs.
  - Creating connections between devices to form a topology.
  - Sending and receiving data.

- **Data Link Layer Functionalities:**
  - Creating layer 2 devices: bridge and switch.
  - Address learning in switches.
  - Error control protocol (Parity Check).
  - Access control protocol (CSMA/CD).
  - Sliding window-based flow control protocol.

### Submission 2: Network Layer

- **Network Layer Functionalities:**
  - Creating and configuring a router.
  - Assigning well-formatted classless IPv4 addresses to devices.
  - Using ARP to find the MAC address of a host within a network.
  - Performing static routing.
  - Implementing RIP or OSPF protocols for dynamic routing.

### Submission 3: Transport and Application Layer

- **Transport Layer Functionalities:**
  - Assigning port numbers to various processes.
  - Implementing sliding window flow control protocol (Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat).
  
- **Application Layer Functionalities:**
  - Telnet service.
  - FTP service.

## File Structure

- **physical_layer.py:** Implementation of physical layer functionalities.
- **data_link_layer.py:** Implementation of data link layer functionalities.
- **network_layer.py:** Implementation of network layer functionalities.
- **transport_application_layer.py:** Implementation of transport and application layer functionalities.
- **README.md:** This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharmashubam/computer_networks_project.git
```
2. Run the desired Python script to simulate different layers and functionalities.
        python physical_layer.py
        python data_link_layer.py
        python network_layer.py
        python transport_application_layer.py


## Test Cases

Test cases for each functionality have been provided within the Python scripts to demonstrate the working of the simulator.
